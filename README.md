# Hey there! Welcome to NarrativeFlow.

My name is Mitch. I'm the creator of NarrativeFlow.

Here, in this repo, you'll find the Interpreter Scripts for using your compiled NarrativeFlow project files with your game engine.

Don't know what NarrativeFlow is?

If you're a video game dev who needs stellar narrative for your game, NarrativeFlow gives you the freedom to visually design powerful narrative—***fast***.

# Get The Interpreter Script

If you're already familiar with NarrativeFlow, you're probably here to get the Interpreter Script for your game engine.

The NarrativeFlow Interpreter Script is already available in:
- C#
- C++
- Lua
- JavaScript (i.e. for Construct 3, Phaser, ImpactJS),
- Python (i.e. for Ren'py),
- GML (GameMaker Studio),
- GDScript (Godot Engine)

You can scroll up and download your version from the repository file tree.

Lua and C++ don't have native JSON parsing features, so for your convenience, I've already included relevant code within those Interpreter Script versions for using a common JSON parsing library: dkjson for Lua, and nlohmann/json for C++.

You'll need to download the relevant code library/script and include it in your code for the JSON parsing to work:
- [dkjson](https://dkolf.de/dkjson-lua/) (for the Lua version)
- [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) (for the C++ version)

If the respective JSON parsing library works for your needs, great! If not, then feel free to use whichever JSON parsing library you want, no hard feelings.

While I'm comfortable with all of the programming languages listed above, I'm certainly not a master of any of them.

So if there's an obvious optimization or better way of doing something, thank you for understanding, and feel free to suggest improvements.

# How To Use The Interpreter Script In Your Game Engine

To learn how to use the Interpreter Script in your game engine, be sure to read the [NarrativeFlow docs page](https://narrativeflow.dev/narrativeflow-docs/Using+NarrativeFlow+With+Your+Game+Engine) about it.

## Code License For NarrativeFlow's Interpreter Scripts

In an effort to protect my livelihood (thank you for supporting my family!), I use a slightly modified MIT license.

Don't worry, the only reason I'm using a custom license is to prevent the standalone selling of the Interpreter Script itself.

Other than that, I want you to use the Interpreter Script in your commercial products and modify it according to your needs, so have fun!

If you have any questions about the license or Interpreter Script, please [reach out to me here](https://narrativeflow.dev/lets-talk).

I'm so excited to see the incredible video game narratives that you've created with NarrativeFlow!

Thank you for your support and kindness,
